# Haptics-with-Strain-Gauge
This project aims at showing the principle design of [virtual sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_sensing) in robotic applications with haptic functionality using **sparse sensor configuration**.

It includes five major parts:
- Robot's limb design, manufacturing in mechanical aspect.
- Sensor choice, positioning, assembly, data acquision in mechatronic aspect.
- Data postprocessing in functionality aspect.
- Automatic data collection system in application aspect.
- System integration in robotic application aspect.

## Research agent
We adapt one open-source project ["Poppy Project-Humanoids"](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) and make contributions to optimize the hardware, software, and web tools.

In this repository, we introduce haptic feedback in robot's limb, which realizes single-contact and **multi-contact** stimulation localization and quantifization functions.
